# Course Project

## Description
This project contains a web application that I coded using a design I obtained from Figma, utilizing React, Firebase, Tailwind CSS, and React Icons. The application includes a landing page, user authentication, registration, and course viewing functionalities.

## Features
- Landing Page: The main page of the application presents users with the overall concept of the project.
- User Authentication and Registration: User login and registration processes provided using Firebase Authentication.
- Course Viewing: Users are not allowed to watch courses without logging in. Users authenticated with Firebase Authentication can watch available courses.

## Usage
1. Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/username/project-name.git`
2. Navigate to the project: `cd project-name`
3. Install the necessary dependencies: `npm install`
4. Set up Firebase configuration:
   - Create a new project in the Firebase console.
   - Enable Firebase Authentication and Firestore.
   - Add your Firebase configuration details to the `firebaseConfig.js` file in the `src/firebase` directory.
5. Start the application: `npm start`
